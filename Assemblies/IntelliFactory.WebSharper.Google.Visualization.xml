<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.toJSON">
<summary>
 Returns a string representation of this DataView. This string does not contain the
 actual data; it only contains the DataView-specific settings such as visible rows and
 columns. You can store this string and pass it to the static DataView.fromJSON()
 constructor to recreate this view. This won&apos;t include generated columns.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.setRows(System.Int32[])">
<summary>
 Sets the visible rows in this view, based on index numbers from the underlying
 table/view. rowIndexes should be an array of index numbers specifying which rows to
 show in the view. The array specifies the order in which to show the rows, and rows
 can be duplicated. Note that only the rows specified in rowIndexes will be shown;
 this method clears all other rows from the view. The array can also contain
 duplicates, effectively duplicating the specified row in this view (for example,
 setRows([3, 4, 3, 2]) will cause row 3 to appear twice in this view). The array thus
 provides a mapping of the rows from the underlying table/view to this view. You can
 use getFilteredRows() or getSortedRows() to generate input for this method.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.setRows(System.Int32,System.Int32)">
<summary>
 Sets the rows in this view to be all indexes (in the underlying table/view) that lie
 between min and max (inclusive). This is a convenience syntax for setRows(rowIndexes)
 above. For example, setRows(5, 10) is equivalent to setRows([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).

<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.setColumns(System.Int32[])">
<summary>
 Specifies which columns are visible in this view. Any columns not specified will be
 hidden. This is an array of column indexes in the underlying table/view, or
 calculated columns. If you don&apos;t call this method, the default is to show all
 columns. The array can also contain duplicates, to show the same column multiple
 times. Columns will be shown in the order specified.
 
     * columnIndexes - An array of numbers and/or objects. Numbers are column index
       values in the underlying table/view. Objects are descriptions of a calculated
       column. A calculated column creates a value on the fly for each row and adds it
       to the view. The object must have the following properties:
           o calc [function] - A function that takes two values, the DataTable that
           the view is built on, and the number of the row being generated, and
           returns a single value of type type described below.
           o type [string] - The JavaScript type of the value that the calc function
           returns.
           o label [Optional, string] - An optional label to assign to this generated
           column.
           o id [Optional, string] - An optional ID to assign to this generated
           column.
 
 // Column 1 is a value in centimeters, and the third column is
 // a generated column that converts this into inches.
 view.setColumns([0,1,{calc:myFunc, type:&apos;number&apos;, label:&apos;Height in Inches&apos;}]);
 function myFunc(dataTable, rowNum){
   return Math.floor(dataTable.getValue(rowNum, 1) / 2.54);

<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.hideRows(System.Int32[])">
<summary>
 Hides the specified rows from the current view. rowIndexes is an array of numbers
 representing the indexes of the rows to hide. These indexes are the index numbers in
 the underlying table/view. The numbers in rowIndexes do not have to be in order (that
 is, [3,4,1] is fine). The remaining rows retain their index order. Entering an index
 number for a row already hidden is not an error, but entering an index that does not
 exist in the underlying table/view will throw an error. To unhide rows, call
 setRows().

<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataView.hideRows(System.Int32,System.Int32)">
<summary>
 Hides all rows with indexes that lie between min and max (inclusive) from the current
 view. This is a convenience syntax for hideRows(rowIndexes) above. For example,
 hideRows(5, 10) is equivalent to hideRows([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).

 numbers in the underlying table/view. The numbers in columnIndexes do not have to be
 in order (that is, [3,4,1] is fine). The remaining columns retain their index order
 when you iterate through them. Entering an index number for a column already hidden
 is not an error, but entering an index that does not exist in the underlying

<member name="T:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataTable">
<summary>
 Represents a two-dimensional, mutable table of values. To make a read-only copy of a
 DataTable (optionally filtered to show specific values, rows, or columns), create a
 DataView.
 Each column is assigned a data type, plus several optional properties including an
 ID, label, and pattern string.
 In addition, you can assign custom properties (name/value pairs) to any cell, row,
 column, or the entire table. Some visualizations support specific custom properties;
 for example the Table visualization supports a cell property called &apos;style&apos;, which
 lets you assign an inline CSS style string to the rendered table cell. A
 visualization should describe in its documentation any custom properties that it
 supports.

<member name="M:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Base.DataCommon.getSortedRows(System.Int32)">
<summary>
 Returns a sorted version of the table without modifying the order of the underlying
 data. To permanently sort the underlying data, call sort(). You can specify sorting
 in a number of ways, depending on the type you pass in to the sortColumns parameter:
 
     * A single number specifies the index of the column to sort by. Sorting will be
       in ascending order.
 
     * A single object that contains the number of the column index to sort by, and an
       optional boolean property desc. If desc is set to true, the specific column
       will be sorted in descending order; otherwise, sorting is in ascending order.
 
     * An array of numbers of the column indexes by which to sort. The first number is
       the primary column by which to sort, the second one is the secondary, and so
       on. This means that when two values in the first column are equal, the values
       in the next column are compared, and so on.
 
     * An array of objects, each one with the number of the column index to sort by,
       and an optional boolean property desc. If desc is set to true, the specific
       column will be sorted in descending order (the default is ascending order). The
       first object is the primary column by which to sort, the second one is the
       secondary, and so on. This means that when two values in the first column are
       equal, the values in the next column are compared, and so on.
 
 The returned value is an array of numbers, each number is an index of a DataTable
 row. Iterating on the DataTable rows by the order of the returned array will result
 in rows ordered by the specified sortColumns. The output can be used as input to
 DataView.setRows() to quickly change the displayed set of rows in a visualization.
 
 Note that the sorting is guaranteed to be stable: this means that if you sort on
 equal values of two rows, the same sort will return the rows in the same order every
 time.

 Specifies a foreground color and/or background color to a cell, depending on the cell
 value. Any cell with a value in the specified from—to range (non-inclusive) will be
 assigned color and bgcolor. It is important to realize that the range is
 non-inclusive, because creating a range from 1—1,000 and a second from 1,000—2,000
 will not cover the value 1,000!
 
     * from - [String, Number, Date, DateTime, or TimeOfDay] The lower boundary
       (non-inclusive) of the range, or null. If null, it will match -∞. String
       boundaries are compared alphabetically against string values.
     * to - [String, Number, Date, DateTime, or TimeOfDay] The high boundary

<summary>
 Assigns a background color from a range, according to the cell value. The color is
 scaled to match the cell&apos;s value within a range from a lower boundary color to an
 upper boundary color. Note that this method cannot compare string values, as
 addRange() can. Tip: Color ranges are often hard for viewers to gauge accurately; the
 simplest and easiest to read range is from a fully saturated color to white (e.g.,
 #FF0000—FFFFFF).
 
     * from - [Number, Date, DateTime, or TimeOfDay] The lower boundary

       of the range, or null. If null, it will match +∞.

       for all cells, no matter what their value.
     * fromBgColor - The background color for cells holding values at the low end of
       the gradient. Values can be either &apos;#RRGGBB&apos; values or defined color constants,
       (example: &apos;#FF0000&apos; or &apos;red&apos;).

<member name="F:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Visualizations.IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Visualizations.AnnotatedTimeLineOptions.scaleType">
<summary>
 Sets the maximum and minimum values shown on the Y axis. The following options are
 available:
 
     * &apos;maximized&apos; - The Y axis will span the minimum to the maximum values of the
       series. If you have more than one series, use allmaximized.
 
     * &apos;fixed&apos; [default] - The Y axis varies, depending on the data values values:
 
           o If all values are &gt;=0, the Y axis will span from zero to the maximum data
           value.
 
           o If all values are &lt;=0, the Y axis will span from zero to the minimum data
           value.
 
           o If values are both positive and negative, the Y axis will range from the
           series maximum to the series minimum.
 
             For multiple series, use &apos;allfixed&apos;.
 
     * &apos;allmaximized&apos; - Same as &apos;maximized,&apos; but used when multiple scales are
       displayed. Both charts will be maximized within the same scale, which means
       that one will be misrepresented against the Y axis, but hovering over each
       series will display it&apos;s true value.
 
     * &apos;allfixed&apos; - Same as &apos;fixed,&apos; but used when multiple scales are displayed. This
       setting adjusts each scale to the series to which it applies (use this in
       conjunction with scaleColumns).
 
 If you specify the min and/or max options, they will take precedence over the minimum
 and maximum values determined by your scale type.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="F:IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Visualizations.IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Google.Visualization.Visualizations.AnnotatedTimeLineOptions.scaleColumns">
<summary>
 Specifies which values to show on the Y axis tick marks in the graph. The default is
 to have a single scale on the right side, which applies to both series; but you can
 have different sides of the graph scaled to different series values.
 
 This option takes an array of zero to three numbers specifying the (zero-based) index
 of the series to use as the scale value. Where these values are shown depends on how
 many values you include in your array:
 
     * If you specify an empty array, the chart will not show Y values next to the
       tick marks.
     * If you specify one value, the scale of the indicated series will be displayed
       on the right side of the chart only.
     * If you specify two values, a the scale for the second series will be added to
       the right of the chart.
     * If you specify three values, a scale for the third series will be added to the
       middle of the chart.
     * Any values after the third in the array will be ignored.
 
 When displaying more than one scale, it is advisable to set the scaleType option to
 either &apos;allfixed&apos; or &apos;allmaximized&apos;.
</summary>

 The patterns should be in the format as specified by the java DecimalFormat class.
 
     * If not specified, the default format pattern is used.
     * If a single string pattern is specified, it is used for all of the values.
     * If a map is specified, the keys are (zero-based) indexes of series, and the
       values are the patterns to be used to format the specified series.
       You are not required to include a format for every series on teh chart; any

<summary>
 If and how to enable paging through the data. Choose one of the following string
 values:
     * &apos;enable&apos; - The table will include page-forward and page-back buttons. Clicking
       on these buttons will perform the paging operation and change the displayed
       page. You might want to also set the pageSize option.
     * &apos;event&apos; - The table will include page-forward and page-back buttons, but
       clicking them will trigger a &apos;page&apos; event and will not change the displayed
       page. This option should be used when the code implements its own page turning
       logic. See the TableQueryWrapper example for an example of how to handle paging
       events manually.

<summary>
 An object in which each property name describes a table element, and the property
 value is a string, defining a class to assign to that table element. Use this
 property to assign custom CSS to specific elements of your table. To use this
 property, assign an object, where the property name specifies the table element, and
 the property value is a string, specifying a class name to assign to that
 element. You must then define a CSS style for that class on your page. The following
 property names are supported:
 
     * headerRow - Assigns a class name to the table header row (&lt;tr&gt; element).
     * tableRow - Assigns a class name to the non-header rows (&lt;tr&gt; elements).
     * oddTableRow - Assigns a class name to odd table rows (&lt;tr&gt; elements). Note: the
       alternatingRowStyle option must be set to true.
     * selectedTableRow - Assigns a class name to the selected table row (&lt;tr&gt; element).
     * hoverTableRow - Assigns a class name to the hovered table row (&lt;tr&gt; element).
